Now the Cloud Kingdom is trapped in endless storms, and the Cloud Palace cries out for help.\n\nThree heroes have climbed the Sky Ladder to answer the call. A Sky Stalker who can find paths no one else can see. A Sun Flare who carries fire bright enough to pierce any storm. And a Cloud Dancer whose gentle heart can befriend any creature of the sky.\n\nThe broken bridge stretches before them. Thunder rumbles in the distance.\n\nAre you ready?",

They spin and dance and connect - rebuilding the bridge more beautiful than ever before!\n\nThe Cloud Palace gates swing open. Tiny cloud sprites pour out, cheering! They surround the heroes with sparkles and songs of thanks.\n\nThe grateful Cloud Guardian kneels before each hero:\n\n'Sun Flare, and brave Ember - you brought light to the darkest storm.'\n\n'Cloud Dancer, and swift Starshine - you brought joy to a kingdom that had forgotten how to smile.'\n\n'Sky Stalker, master of the Lightning Bow - you brought courage when all seemed lost.'\n\nThe Rainbow Bridge gleams in the sunshine, connecting all the floating islands once more. The Cloud Kingdom is saved!\n\nThe Sun Flare hugs Ember tight. The Cloud Dancer braids flowers into Starshine's rainbow mane. The Sky Stalker looks out at the kingdom they protected, the Lightning Bow across their back.\n\nAnother adventure complete. Another kingdom saved. And somewhere out there... another adventure waits.\n\n🌈 THE END 🌈",
