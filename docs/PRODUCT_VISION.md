# Product Vision

## What Problem Are We Solving?

Many families want engaging, screen-time activities that are:
- **Interactive** (not just passive watching)
- **Collaborative** (brings family together)
- **Age-appropriate** (safe, positive, educational)
- **Easy to use** (no complex setup or accounts)
- **Story-driven** (narrative that kids care about)

Traditional options (TV, games, apps) often:
- Are passive or isolating
- Require accounts/subscriptions
- Have inappropriate content
- Don't encourage family interaction
- Are too complex for young kids

**Adventures** solves this by providing:
- Interactive storytelling where parent guides, kids participate
- Two-screen setup that brings family together
- Age-appropriate content (5-7 years)
- Zero-friction setup (no accounts)
- Engaging narratives with choices and outcomes
